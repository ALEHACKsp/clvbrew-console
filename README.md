# clvbrew-console
A console application for obfuscating Lua scripts with clvbrew, a private obfuscator.

## About
Yes. The code is abysmal. In my defense, I wasn't looking to sink a ton of effort in and doing it the way I did seemed reasonable, although I was disgusted afterwards. Anyway, if you stumbled across this by chance, then you probably have no use for it, especially as it requires an API key. If someone, like me for example, referred you to this, then you probably know what it is.

## Dependencies
If builing from source, you will need [nlohmann's JSON library](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) and [whoshuu's C++ requests](https://github.com/whoshuu/cpr).
